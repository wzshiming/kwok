[KWOK] is a toolkit that enables setting up a cluster of thousands of Nodes in seconds.
Under the scene, all Nodes are simulated to behave like real ones, so the overall approach employs
a pretty low resource footprint that you can easily play around on your laptop.

So far we provide two tools:

- **kwok:** Core of this repo. It simulates thousands of fake Nodes.
- **kwokctl:** A CLI to facilitate creating and managing clusters simulated by Kwok.

Please see [our website] for more in-depth information.
